        "Online fashion is one of the fastest growing and biggest industries in the world. With the convenience of the comfort of your home it allows users to update their wardrobe at the tips of their fingers. However for users or potential customers sometimes it takes an unnecessary amount of time to find the right item, the right shop and the right prices. More of then than not the items that the users/customer see over their screen will come in differently that what they are expected, it then forced user to return the items with extra cost that usually at a loss of the customers.\n",

        "Currently big online fashion retailers are using Artificial Intelligence to help their customers making decisions. ASOS uses FitAnalytics a machine learning platform to help customers recommended right sizes based on past purchases of other customers that have similar size and their personal past purchases (Johnson, 2019). This has helped ASOS and other online retailers that using FitAnalytics to reduce the numbers of returns that usually takes 20% of e-commerce business compared to returns in brick and mortar, it also has helped the customer to gain confidence to shop online (Turk, 2018). \n",
        "FitAnalytics is very successful that it also have been adapted to the biggest Australian online retailers such as The Iconic, JD Sports, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, BooHoo and many more (FitAnalytics.com, 2019). This proves that artificial intelligence is a growing needs in online fashion retailer. \n",

It could either due to the cost perspective, different sizing and stock availability. Most of today’s online retailer users tend to browse from social media platforms, particularly Instagram to see how it is been worn by their peers or instagram influencer and even simply just checking what is the current and the next fashion trend. Browsing from Instagram also helps customer to determine whether this style will suit their wardrobe, their needs and lifestyle as they can relate better and seeing the item in real life situation.\n"

        "The world today revolves around social media, we are frequently bombarded by media particularly advertisements. One of the biggest advertisers in social media is retail fashion ranging from haute couture to high street fashion. Users are left with so many choices, sometimes too many, from price point of view, quality and purposes. When bombarded with too many choices users will eventually get overwhelmed and tend to bail on purchasing. According to a study by Nagar and Gandotra when customer is bombarded with a large number of choices they will only enjoy the initial process of it, towards the end customer tend to get confused when taking final decision due to too much information (Nagar and Gandotra, 2016). \n",
